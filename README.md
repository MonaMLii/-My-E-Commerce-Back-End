## Usage
```
On a functional Express.js API
- I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize, When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file.
- A development database is created and is seeded with test data, When I enter schema and seed commands
- My server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database, When I enter the command to invoke the application.
- The data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON, When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags.
